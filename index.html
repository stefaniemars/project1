        </div>
            <p>NIRI stands for Near Infra-Red Imaging, which is a system used for early 
               detection of enamel lesions. It offers higher sensitivity compared to 
               bitewing radiography and has already demonstrated comparable 
               sensitivity in detecting dentin lesions.</p>
            <p>A multicenter clinical study has confirmed the benefits of this system 
               as a tool for detecting and monitoring interproximal caries lesions 
               above the gingiva without the need for X-ray radiation.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The day provided an insight into the future of dentistry, which is 
           undoubtedly becoming completely digital. From single crowns and 
           veneers to corticotomies or orthognathic surgeries, everything can 
           now be precisely planned, visualized, and executed with absolute 
           predictability using a "copy-and-paste" technique. The treatment of 
           the future will require a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Endodontic Billing: BEMA vs. GOZ Coverage</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Endodontic procedures for patients with statutory health insurance 
           are subject to cost-effectiveness requirements, similar to other 
           areas of dental conservation. However, dental professional societies 
           and university clinics are advocating for more therapeutic steps to 
           enhance the quality and long-term outcomes of root canal 
           treatment, based on research studies. Balancing compliance with 
           statutory guidelines and meeting scientific standards can 
           sometimes be challenging for practitioners, as these requirements 
           often differ significantly.</p>
